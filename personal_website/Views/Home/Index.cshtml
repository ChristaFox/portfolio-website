    <p>I have a passion for people and design--whether it be the look of a website, photo, book, etc. I have worked in retail for over ten years, and assisting clients and meeting their needs and expectations is something I take pride in. I love teaching clients how to navigate through the new technologies that will make their lives simpler.</p>
    <p>I'm currently in my Senior year of my Bachelor's for Computer Science at Franklin University. I previously received an Associate’s in the field from Salt Lake Community College. Before this, I received a certificate in Photojournalism from Fresno City College.</p>
    <p>I was born in Fresno, CA. The area is rich with creative individuals. I had the pleasure of speaking with a few and put together the following book.</p>
